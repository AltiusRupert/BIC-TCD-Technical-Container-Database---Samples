## User Roles

You can use Boxtech as either:

* Consumer 
* Uploader

### Consumers

As a consumer you get full access to Boxtech to query the containers in the database, you only need the container number you are looking for and you can [search using the web interface](web/search-boxtech.md) for occasional use OR use the [API to integrate or script queries](api/api-documentation.md) to Boxtech from your own application.

You will need to register to gain access, and can start using the application immediately.

### Uploaders

To add your containers to boxtech and manage your fleet or apply alerts to containers you will need to have uploader rights. To qualify for this you will need to register as an uploader in Boxtech and provide the BIC prefix that applies to you.

This information is verified by BIC and once approved you will have the ability to start managing your container fleet and alerts.

You will gain immediate access to Boxtech but only have uploader rights until verification has taken place.
