This client access will help you understand the API before starting to write code to automate the calls. This guide will take around 10 minutes to complete Signup for Boxtech API Visit https://www.bic-boxtech.org/sign-up/ Signup for a new user account to access data. Accept Terms and Conditions. Confirm your account activation by clicking the link received by email. You now have a &lt;username&gt; and &lt;password&gt; you can use in the API. Get hold of Postman Download Postman to your desktop or run it in your browser. Create a (free account) to save your tests for future reference. Authentication Now you are in postman, create a ‘New Tab’ at the top of the screen Configure the BoxTech API Authentication call : select the POST operation enter http://app.bic-boxtech.org/oauth/token for the URL add 2 headers in the Headers section : Key Value Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded Authorization Basic YmljYXBwOmJpY3NlY3JldGFwcA== Note : the value of the Authorization key is called the &lt;clientid&gt; Move to the Body section : select the x-www-url-encoded type of body add 3 values in the body : key = grant_type, value = password key = username, value = &lt;your_username&gt; key = paswsword, value = &lt;your_password&gt; save your work by clicking Save on the right, and store it in a collection you will call BIC BoxTech Click Send : you should get a response which looks like this : Grab the “accessToken” value, in our case : 784b64f338a812343915c6f4734d2f71fe14a68d Call Tare_kg In Postman, create a new tab at the top of the screen. Configure the BoxTech API Tare_kg call : select the GET operation use the http://test-bic-container.herokuapp.com/api/tare_kg/GLDU5334260 URL : this will query for the GLDU5334260 container. Note the format of the container number which includes the check digit add 1 header in the Headers section : key = Authorization, value = Bearer 784b64f338a812343915c6f4734d2f71fe14a68d (or in your case, Bearer followed by the &lt;accessToken&gt; you saved previously, separated by a blank space) save your work which should look like this : Click Send : you should get a response like this : The tare weight of the container is 2232 kg. Call Tare_lbs You can practise on your own creating a new test in a new tab to call the tare_lbs service, with the same parameters, to query for the tare weight in lbs. Same tests in Production To run the same tests in the BIC BoxTech Production database : signup for a “Data access only” user in production. Accept Terms and Conditions. Confirm your account activation by clicking the link received by email. You now have a production &lt;username&gt; and &lt;password&gt; you can use in the API in production use the http://app.bic-boxtech.org/oauth/token URL for authentication in production use the http://app.bic-boxtech.org/api/tare_kg URL for the Tare (kg) service in production use the http://app.bic-boxtech.org/api/tare_lbs URL for the Tare (lbs) service in production",

There are some sample use cases detailed to help understand how you may use some of the information available. Boxtech data is provided with support from the shipping lines, lease companies and other container operators, giving more detail than is available on the container door and identifying the current operator for the container in the case of lease containers. Full details can be found on the website BIC are a non-profit organisation serving the container transportation industry. How to get started with Boxtech To start using the Boxtech API you will need to request an API key, the key is free and the only condition of use is that you accept our terms and conditions.
